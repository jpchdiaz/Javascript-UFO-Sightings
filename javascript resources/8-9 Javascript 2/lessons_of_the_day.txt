forEach -- will iterate through elements of an array and will execute any function and output to console

map -- will iterate through elements of an array and WILL RETURN the results when splitting a JS Object into individual lists

forEach and map without the keyword 'function' and replaced with =>
  in case of map we can eliminate return and have the logic on a single line
